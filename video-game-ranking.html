<h1>The Best Video Games According to Mark</h1>
<h2>My top 3 video games of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Red Dead Redemption</h3>
<p>Probably my favorite of all time. The open world, the nostalgia of it, I have a lot of memories playing it so that's why this is ranked first.</p>
<h3>GTA IV</h3>
<p>This one is a classic. Another open world great, like Red Dead Redemeption but a more modern version.</p>
<h3>Fallout New Vegas</h3>
<p>Sticking with the open world theme, this RPG is a classic. You could play this game theoretically forever, since every conversation you have in-game can lead to different outcomes.</p>
