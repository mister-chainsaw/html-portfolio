<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />
<p>I was born and raised in South Jersey, and from a young age I always loved learning about how things worked.
  Originally thinking engineering was what I wanted to do, taking one calculus class showed me that engineering was not for me. 
  So, I decided to go to study Biochemistry, and I now work in clinical logistics. 
</p>

<p>While I enjoy the hustle and bustle of logistics, I wanted something more and decided to take an online course to learn coding.
  This website serves as a showcase of all my projects so far. I hope you enjoy! I am always trying to learn new things, so any feedback is appreciated!

<p>Peace Out,</p>
